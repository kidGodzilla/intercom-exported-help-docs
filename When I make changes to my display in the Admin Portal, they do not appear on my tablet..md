# When I make changes to my display in the Admin Portal, they do not appear on my tablet.

Sometimes tablets do not immediately reflect changes made in the admin portal, even after they are saved multiple times.

Normally, you should see updates on your tablet within a minute, without restarting the application. A small number of changes may require an application restart to take effect, such as updating impersonation settings.

If you do not see your changes reflected on your display, the first thing you should try is restarting the application.

However, in some cases, your email tenant (Office 365 or G Suite) may report a different tenant domain than you used to sign in. This is common in scenarios where you have an  [onmicrosoft.com](http://onmicrosoft.com/)  domain, but sign in with another domain, or vice-versa.

In this case, you can try logging out of your display, and reloading your display by  **Display Key**. This will use a custom display key to load your display profile, which you can retrieve from the  [admin portal](https://beta.meetingroom365.com/).

You may need to press "Clear Local Storage" after logging out to log in as a different user, or enter a display key.

If you run into any issues, please contact support and we can take a look at your tenant and update your configuration manually.
