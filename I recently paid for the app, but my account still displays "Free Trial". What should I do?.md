# I recently paid for the app, but my account still displays "Free Trial". What should I do?

Some users have experienced an issue where their subscription is not immediately reflected after payment.

Usually, it is nothing to worry about, and it will resolve itself after a short delay. You should still be able to use the app, even though it is labeled "unpaid", and will be contacted before any displays are affected.

In some cases, the email used to subscribe does not match your account email, and your payment must be applied manually.

If you believe this is the case, or if this problem persists, please contact us and we will update your account manually.
