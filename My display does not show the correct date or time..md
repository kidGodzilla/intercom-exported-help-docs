# My display does not show the correct date or time.

If your display is showing the time as one hour behind, or one hour ahead, it is most likely due to the device's not recognizing DST (Daylight Saving Time). Otherwise, if your display is showing a completely different time, you should make sure the device's timezone is configured correctly.

You can try the following solutions:

1.  Verify that your timezone settings are correctly configured.
2.  Make sure that the operating system on the tablet is up to date with all the updates and patches.

The problem can be due to the libraries on the tablet's operating system. The libraries are the place your tablet accesses to transform the time from the UTC type (the type of time coding that we supply) to your local time zone.

If this didn't fix the problem, please send us a message and we'll do the custom adjustments needed to have all your displays running perfectly.
