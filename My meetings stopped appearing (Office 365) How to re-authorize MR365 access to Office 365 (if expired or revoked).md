# My meetings stopped appearing (Office 365)

How to re-authorize MR365 access to Office 365 (if expired or revoked)

You may have received a message from Meeting Room 365, similar to the one below, or noticed that Office 365 meetings no longer appear on your display.  

_This is an automated message from Meeting Room 365._  
  
_We're getting an error response from a Microsoft API being accessed to support your Meeting Room 365 display._

This can be caused by a number of factors, however, the issue is that Office 365 no longer believes Meeting Room 365 has access to read your calendar.

## Re-authorize Meeting Room 365

You can resolve this issue by re-authorizing Meeting Room 365 for access to Office 365 via the admin portal.  
  
You can do that by repeating a portion of the setup process, which may have changed since you first set up your displays.  
  
From  [https://manage.meetingroom365.com/#/new?office-365](https://manage.meetingroom365.com/#/new?office-365)  you can skip directly to the second tab (Connect An Office 365 Account).

Click Sign in with Office 365 and when you're returned, it should give you your display key.
