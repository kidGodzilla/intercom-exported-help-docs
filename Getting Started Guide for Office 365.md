In this article, we'll cover the entire process for setting up Meeting Room displays for Office 365. The first portion of this guide occurs in the Office 365 Admin Portal. So, if you rely on another IT administrator to manage your Office 365 tenant, you'll want to include that person for step 1.  

## Project Outline:

1.  **Create Room Resource Mailboxes**  in Office 365
2.  **Create Meeting Room Displays** in Meeting Room 365
3.  **Set up hardware**  in your office

## Step One: Create Room Resource Mailboxes in Office 365

The first (and most complicated) step is to create your resource mailboxes in Office 365. Each meeting room in your space will need to be assigned a  **Resource Mailbox**from the Office 365 Admin Portal.

This gives it a unique email address and calendar, which will accept and manage meeting invites on behalf of your room.

The tricky part is at the end: you will need to perform a password reset to retrieve (or create) a password for each resource mailbox.

An in-depth guide can be found  [here](https://medium.com/meeting-room-365/how-to-add-a-meeting-room-to-outlook-or-office-365-free-cc07ace93534).

  

## Step Two: Create Meeting Room Displays in Meeting Room 365

Next, you will create your Meeting Room displays in Meeting Room 365.

There is a wizard which can be accessed from the  [Meeting Room 365 Admin Portal](https://manage.meetingroom365.com/), to provision a new Meeting Room display for Office 365.

Click the **Red Plus**  in the bottom left corner of the admin portal, and select  **Office 365**.

Next, you will be guided through the process of setting up a resource mailbox (if you haven't already), sign into Office 365 (with your resource mailbox credentials), and finally given a  **Display Key**, which you can use to set up your tablet display.

  

## Step Three: Set up Hardware in your Office

The final step is to download the Meeting Room 365 app from the app store of choice for your display (iTunes, Google Play, or the Amazon App Store).

When prompted, select  `Enter Display Key`, and enter your display key.

**_Tip:_** _You can use_ **_spaces_** _and arbitrary_ **_capitalization_** _to make entering the key easier, especially on devices with auto-correct turned on. Meeting Room 365 will strip these details out automatically._

## That’s it! If you’re stuck, you can always contact us from your admin portal, and we can help you out with setup, configuration, and provisioning.
