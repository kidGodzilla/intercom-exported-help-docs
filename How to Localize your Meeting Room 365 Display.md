# Customizing your Language

i18n file customization lets you update the strings displayed on your meeting room display. You can download an  [**example i18n file (English)**](https://meetingroom365.com/app/en.i18n.json), and use it to make your desired changes. Then, paste the result in your display configuration to see changes in real time.

This allows you to modify any of the strings visible in the display app.

# Examples and Existing Translations

We have put together a repository to consolidate translations as they are requested or contributed.

Here’s an example of one we created for testing:

You can  [download an example i18n file](https://meetingroom365.com/app/en.i18n.json), and paste your translation into the web app.

-   RTL support requires some custom CSS on our end & has not yet been attempted. Contact support if you would like to try it out!

# Customize Time Format

Time format customization allows you to switch to a 24-hour date and time format.
