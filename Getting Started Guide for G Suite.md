In this article, we'll cover the entire process for setting up Meeting Room displays for G Suite. The first half of this process occurs in the G Suite Admin Console. So, if you rely on another IT administrator to manage your G Suite tenant, you'll want to include that person for steps 1-3.

## Project Outline:

1.  **Create a G Suite Service User Account**  in the G Suite Admin Console
2.  **Create Resource Calendar(s)** in the G Suite Admin Console
3.  **Share Calendars**  with your Service User
4.  **Set up Meeting Rooms**  in Meeting Room 365
5.  **Set up hardware**  in your office

  

## Step One: Create a Service User in the G Suite Admin Console

The first step is to create a G Suite service user, which can read your resource calendar data on behalf of Meeting Room 365 (i.e.  [_calendars@yourdomain.com_](mailto:calendars@yourdomain.com)  or  [_mr365@yourdomain.com_](mailto:mr365@yourdomain.com), etc.).

This user will need to be (at minimum) a  **limited admin**, usually a  `Service Admin`.

This process takes place in the G Suite Admin Console, and a detailed guide can be found  [here](https://medium.com/@jamesfuthey/ddefc2ff3cf3).

  

## Step Two: Create Resource Calendars in the G Suite Admin Console

Each meeting room in your space will need to be assigned a  **Resource Calendar**  in the G Suite Admin Console. This gives it a unique email address (although it's not very user friendly), which will accept and manage meeting invites on behalf of your room.

A couple of things to note, is that each room will need to be organized by building and location.

## Step Three: Share Calendars with your Service User (G Suite Admin Console)

Next, you'll need to  [share the calendars with your service user](https://support.google.com/a/answer/1034381?hl=en)  (done from each resource calendar).

This will give your G Suite account write permissions for the Resource Calendar, which facilitates the instant reservation, extend meeting, and end early features.

  

## Step Four: Set up Meeting Rooms in Meeting Room 365

There is a wizard which can be accessed from the  [Meeting Room 365 Admin Portal](https://manage.meetingroom365.com/), to provision a new Meeting Room display for G Suite.

Click the **Red Plus**  in the bottom left corner of the admin portal, and select  **G Suite**.

Next, you will be guided through the process of setting up a resource calendar (if you haven't already), sign into G Suite (with your Service User credentials), and finally given a  **Display Key**, which you can use to set up your tablet display.

## Step Five: Set up Hardware

The final step is to download the Meeting Room 365 app from the app store of choice for your display (iTunes, Google Play, or the Amazon App Store).

When prompted, select  `Enter Display Key`, and enter your display key.

**_Tip:_** _You can use_ **_spaces_** _and arbitrary_ **_capitalization_** _to make entering the key easier, especially on devices with auto-correct turned on. Meeting Room 365 will strip these details out automatically._

## That’s it! If you’re stuck, you can always contact us from your admin portal, and we can help you out with setup, configuration, and provisioning.
